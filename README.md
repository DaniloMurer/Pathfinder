Pathfinder
=====
Find Path with the lowest sum from node x to node y.

1. Demands and short explanation of the project

    - [x] Checks if the bottom cell is smaller than the right one
    - [x] Can only move down or right
    - [x] You can give a custom size to the grid
    - [x] Has some JUnit testing implemented
    - [ ] Does essentially work
